# Technical Implementation

This section details the technical implementation of the Music Besties application.

## Data Management

The application's data structure is organized as shown in this diagram, which represents the conceptual model rather than the exact implementation:

**Figure: Data Structure Model**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AlbumObject {
        <<Core Data>>
        String id
        String name
        String emoji
        Array~String~ songs
        +getSongCount() int
        +getFormattedTitle() String
    }
    
    class UserSelections {
        <<User Preferences>>
        String albumId
        Array~String~ selectedSongs
        Array~String~ rankOrder
        +addToRanking(songId) void
        +removeFromRanking(songId) void
        +moveInRanking(songId, newPosition) void
    }
    
    class UserReviews {
        <<User Content>>
        String albumId
        Number rating
        String comment
        DateTime timestamp
        +updateRating(newRating) void
        +updateComment(newComment) void
    }
    
    AlbumObject "1" --o "0..1" UserSelections : references >
    AlbumObject "1" --o "0..1" UserReviews : references >
```

*Conceptual diagram showing the relationships and composition of album objects, user selections, and review data. Provides developers with an understanding of the data architecture to properly implement state management.*

### 6.1.1. Album Metadata

The application manages album metadata including:
- Album ID (e.g., 'taylor-swift', 'red')
- Album name (e.g., 'Taylor Swift', 'Red')
- Representative emoji (e.g., ü§†, ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- List of songs for each album

### 6.1.2. User Data

User-specific data includes:
- Selected songs for each album
- Ranking order of albums and songs
- Star ratings (whole numbers from 0-5)
- Text comments for album reviews

### 6.1.3. State Structure

The application's state is stored in LocalStorage with this structure:

**Figure 6.1.30: LocalStorage Data Structure**

```mermaid
erDiagram
    LOCALSTORAGE ||--o{ ALBUM_DATA : stores
    
    LOCALSTORAGE {
        string key "music-besties-data"
        object value
    }
    
    ALBUM_DATA {
        object selectedSongs
        object rankings
        object reviews
    }
    
    ALBUM_DATA ||--o{ SELECTED_SONGS : contains
    ALBUM_DATA ||--o{ RANKINGS : contains
    ALBUM_DATA ||--o{ REVIEWS : contains
    
    SELECTED_SONGS {
        string albumId
        array songList
    }
    
    RANKINGS {
        string categoryId
        array orderedItems
    }
    
    REVIEWS {
        string albumId
        number rating
        string comment
        datetime timestamp
    }
```

*Exact JSON structure showing the format of stored data including selectedSongs, rankings, and reviews with their nested properties. Ensures consistent data persistence implementation with the correct property names and data types.*

This structure is accessed via the key 'music-besties-data' in the browser's LocalStorage. The application loads this data on startup and updates it when changes are made to rankings or reviews.

## 6.2. Storage Mechanisms

### 6.2.1. LocalStorage

The application uses the browser's LocalStorage API to persist user data between sessions. This approach has the following advantages:

- No server-side storage requirements
- Data remains available even when offline
- Simple API for storing and retrieving JSON data

However, it also has limitations:

- Limited storage capacity (typically 5-10MB)
- Data is specific to a browser and device
- No synchronization between devices

### 6.2.2. In-memory State

During runtime, the application maintains an in-memory state that is synchronized with LocalStorage. This approach provides:

- Fast access to data during user interactions
- Ability to make temporary changes before persisting
- Simplified state management through Vue.js reactivity

## 6.3. Framework and Libraries

### 6.3.1. Vue.js Framework

The application is built using the Vue.js framework, which provides:

- Component-based architecture
- Reactive data binding
- Declarative templating
- Event handling system
- State management

### 6.3.2. Interactive Selection

The application implements interactive selection through:

- Click/tap event handlers
- Vue.js reactive data binding
- CSS transitions for visual feedback

### 6.3.3. CSS Implementation

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling with these specific utility classes:
